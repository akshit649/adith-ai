```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshit649/adith-ai.git
cd adith-ai
```

2️⃣ Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and add the required environment variables:
```env
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
DB_URI=your-database-uri-here
```

5️⃣ Run the Project
```bash
python Main.py
```

🖥️ Usage
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
2. Interact with the AI model using the provided interface
3. Upload data or input text for predictions

🛡️ Security & Best Practices
- Ensure you **DO NOT** commit sensitive data in `.env`
- Use `gitignore` to prevent tracking unnecessary files
- Keep dependencies updated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
